With a single command, it generates the basic scaffolding for a bee-js project in your chosen development environment (CommonJS, ESM, TypeScript, or Vite + TypeScript). WSL WARNING The create-swarm-app tool is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. However, using it in combination with WSL is discouraged due to potential compatibility issues that may require additional troubleshooting. That said, the bee-js library itself works seamlessly within WSL. If you prefer to develop your project using WSL, you can use create-swarm-app to generate the project files on the Windows side, then move them into your WSL environment for development. You can use create-swarm-app to quickly set up scaffolding for a bee-js project with the following command: npm init swarm-app@latest {app-name} {app-type}  Replace &quot;{app-name}&quot; with your app's name, and &quot;{app-type}&quot; with the type of app you want. Supported types are node, node-esm, node-ts and vite-tsx. Start a Swarm project using TypeScript: npm init swarm-app@latest my-dapp node-ts  Your project structure will look like: . ├── package.json ├── src │ ├── config.ts │ └── index.ts └── tsconfig.json  or using Vite and TypeScript: npm init swarm-app@latest my-dapp vite-tsx  Your project structure will look like: tree . . ├── index.html ├── package.json ├── src │ ├── App.tsx │ ├── config.ts │ └── index.tsx └── tsconfig.json  The exact results will differ slightly depending on which {app-type} you use, but they will all include a config.ts or config.js file where the Bee node's API endpoint must be specified.

PSS provides a pub-sub facility that can be used for a variety of tasks. Nodes are able to listen to messages received for a specific topic in their nearest neighbourhood and create messages destined for another neighbourhood which are sent over the network using Swarm's usual data dissemination protocols. The intended use of PSS is to communicate privately with a publicly known identity (to for example initiate further communication directly). Due to the cost of mining the trojan chunks, it is not recommended to use as an instant messaging system. Light nodes are unreachable Be aware! You can not send message to Light nodes!

With single owner chunks, a user can assign arbitrary data to an address and attest chunk integrity with their digital signature. Feeds are a unique feature of Swarm. They constitute the primary use case for single owner chunks. Developers can use Feeds to version revisions of a mutable resource, indexing sequential updates to a topic, publish the parts to streams, or post consecutive messages in a communication channel.

The Signer interface can be used for integration with 3rd party Ethereum wallet applications because Swarm uses the same format for signing chunks that Ethereum uses for signing transactions. Default signer When you are instantiating Bee class you can pass it a default signer that will be used if you won't specify it directly for the makeSOCWriter. See Bee constructor for more info. Ethereum Wallet signers If you want to use your browser Ethereum Wallet like Metamask you can use utility called makeEthereumWalletSigner that we ship with bee-js which creates a Signer object out of given EIP-1193 compatible provider.

One of the most common use cases for feeds is to store mutable data in an immutable address. For example, when hosting a website on Swarm, we may want its address stored in ENS, but we don't want to pay for changing the reference every time the site is updated. A feed is defined by its owner (see above), a topic (32 bytes arbitrary data as a hex string or Uint8Array), and a type. type defines how the updates and lookup of the feed index are made (currently only the sequence type is supported). The publisher is the owner of the feed, and only they can post updates to the feed. Posting an update requires (1) constructing the identifier from the topic and the correct index and (2) signing it concatenated together with the hash of the arbitrary content of the update. Conversely, users can consume a feed by retrieving the chunk by its address. Retrieving an update requires the consumer to construct the address from the owner’s address and the identifier. To calculate the identifier, they need the topic and the appropriate index. For this, they need to know the indexing scheme. Feeds enable Swarm users to represent a sequence of content updates. The content of the update is the payload that the feed owner signs against the identifier. The payload can be a swarm reference from which the user can retrieve the associated data.

This is useful when you're planning to keep data alive for longer and want to increase capacity for uploading more data at the same time. The getExtensionCost method combines both aspects — size and duration — into a single cost calculation, making it easier to understand the overall expense upfront.

In many cases, extending is cheaper, especially for larger and longer-lived batches. If you're happy with the cost, you can then proceed to extend the size and duration individually by calling extendStorageSize and extendStorageDuration as shown in the previous sections.

There are several values we do need to pay attention to however: usable - it takes a short time for a batch to become usable (usually less than a minute) after purchase. Once usable, usable will change from false to true.usage - indicates how much of the batch has been used as a value between 1 and 0.usageText - converts the usage value to a percentage value rounded to the nearest whole number which is then converted to text.size - the amount of data in bytes which the batch can safely store.remainingSize - the amount of date in bytes remaining from size which is still available to be used.duration - an estimate of the remaining batch lifetime in seconds. For an explanation of the remaining values, refer to the &quot;Advanced&quot; section below. tip Note that although 1 GB was specified as input for the bee.buyStorage, the size value is ~4.93 GB.

If 5 GB is used as input, then bee-js will round up to the second breakpoint of 17.03 GB since 5 GB is larger than the first breakpoint of 4.93 GB.
