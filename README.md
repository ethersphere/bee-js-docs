# Bee JS Documentation Website

Documentation for the [Swarm Bee-js javascript library](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-js). View at [bee-js.ethswarm.org](https://bee-js.ethswarm.org).

### Node Version

You must use **node 14** or above. We recommend [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Installation

```
$ npm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Bumping Version
